  <strong>Campaign use case description</strong><br />
  Explanation of Campaign objective or purpose.<br />
  <br />
  If the Campaign pertains to financial services, please include "Direct Lending" in the Campaign description to avoid
  failure or rejection of this Campaign.<br />
  <strong>Successful Example:</strong><br />
  "This Campaign sends OTP for MFA challenges to login to an online portal to make changes to a user profile for
  security purposes. Customer confirms with an SMS when profile changes are made."<br />
  (Campaign description matches sample message and sample message)<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Failure Example:</strong><br />
  "Blank"<br />
  "This Campaign sends appointment information and confirmations to customer"
</ng-template>
<ng-template #flowContent>
  <strong>How do end-users consent to receive messages?</strong><br />
  This field should describe how and when consumers opt-in to the campaign, therefore giving consent to the sender to
  receive their messages. The call-to-action must be explicitly clear and inform consumers of the nature of the program.
  If multiple opt-in methods can be used for the same, list them all.<br />
  <br />
  Provide website where opt-in occurs.<br />
  List all opt-in methods.<br />
  Include an opt-in message if users can text.<br />
  If a website is provided, it must be accessible with privacy policy and terms.<br />
  If opt-in occurs behind a gated login or on paper, provide a hosted link of a screenshot or document of the
  opt-in.<br />
  <strong>Successful Example:</strong><br />
  "Customers provide opt-in specifically when enrolling into our website, or in person by requesting SMS capabilities
  within the store. Opt-in during website is a self-service process and occurs at acme.com/signup. By submitting, you
  authorize ACME to send text messages with offers and other information. Message/data rates apply. Consent is not a
  condition of purchase. [Link to terms and conditions]."
  <br />
  <strong>Failure Example:</strong><br />
  "Customers sign up"<br />
  <br />
  (Where and how the customer provides opt-in is unclear, campaign will be rejected.)
</ng-template>
<ng-template #messageContent>
  <div>
    <strong>Sample messages</strong><br />
    Sample messages should reflect actual messages to be sent under campaign.<br />
    <br />
    Do not use placeholder text for your sample messages<br />
    Use brackets to indicate templated fields in sample message<br />
    Consistency in sample message, use case, and campaign description<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Successful Example:</strong><br />
    "ACME 2FA Notice: Here is your one time password: 1234Call [phone-number] to report if this request was not made by
    you."<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Failure Example:</strong><br />
    "You have an upcoming appointment"
